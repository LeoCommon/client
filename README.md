## (Planned) Functionality
- [x] Modem GPS Starting
- [ ] Task scheduling
- [ ] D-Bus integration 

## Building
GO 1.17 or later is required for building the source code of this package externally. However, if the project is used within SATOS, Buildroot automatically builds the required tooling.

### Manual building instructions
Clone the project and execute: `make` to build all targets. The test version of the `modem_manager` can be invoked by using `make run`.

## Dependencies
APOGEE uses the following automatically managed third-party libraries. 
They are listed in the `go.mod` file and copies of the sources are stored within the `vendor` directory.
