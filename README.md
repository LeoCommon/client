# APOGEE

### Manual building instructions
Clone the project and execute: `make` to build all targets. The test version of the `modem_manager` can be invoked by using `make run`.

## Dependencies
APOGEE uses the following automatically managed third-party libraries. 
They are listed in the `go.mod` file and copies of the sources are stored within the `vendor` directory.
